# dTAO API (BETA)

The dTAO API provides endpoints for querying stake balance and historical stake information for validators in the dTAO network. These endpoints are currently in beta testing.

## ⚠️ Beta Status Notice

These endpoints are running on testnet and are in current testing. They may break as we make changes. If you find any inconsistencies, please let us know on the [feedback channel](https://docs.taostats.io/feedback).

Your standard Taostats API key will work on these endpoints.

## Available Endpoints

- [Get Historical Stake Balance](get-historical-stake-balance.md) - Retrieve historical stake balance records for a validator
- [Get Stake Balance](get-stake-balance.md) - Query current stake balance for a validator
- [Get Validator Emission by Subnet](get-validator-emission.md) - Retrieve validator emission information for specific subnets
